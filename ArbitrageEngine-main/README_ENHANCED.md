## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run system integrity check
npm run integrity-check

# Start enhanced system
npm run enhanced

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test-system
```

### Manual Launch

node core/systemLauncher.js

# Run integrity check only
node core/projectIntegrityCheck.js

# Test individual components
node core/systemTest.js
```

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Integrity Enforcement
- ❌ No queue-based execution allowed
- ❌ No forced overrides (except 0% flash loan fee)
- ❌ No pre-approval of ERC20 tokens
- ✅ All trades require simulation first
- ✅ Circuit breakers and emergency shutdown
- ✅ Project integrity validation on startup

### Risk Management
- Maximum 5% daily drawdown limit
- Position size limits per trade
- Gas price caps and monitoring
- Automatic error counting and shutdown
- Health monitoring with alerts

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-Time Metrics
- Trade success rates by token pair
- Average profit per successful trade
- Gas cost optimization savings
- System uptime and health status
- Memory-based performance scoring

### Logging System
- **Public Logs**: Trade executions, system events, errors
- **Private Logs**: Predictions, memory updates (file-only)
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics, success rates
- **Health**: System status, component monitoring
