## Daily Execution Protocol

### Morning Setup (5 minutes)
1. Check system status: `npm run health-check`
2. Verify wallet connections
3. Review overnight logs
4. Confirm RPC endpoints active

### Development Session (2-3 hours)
1. Pick ONE item from current phase
2. Implement step completely
3. Test thoroughly
4. Document any issues
5. Mark as complete âœ…

### Evening Review (10 minutes)
1. Test all completed features
2. Backup progress
3. Plan next day's target
4. Update checklist

## Troubleshooting Protocol

### If Step Fails:
1. **Stop immediately** - don't proceed to next step
2. **Document the exact error**
3. **Identify root cause**
4. **Fix completely before moving on**
5. **Re-test the step**
6. **Only then proceed**

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **Express not found**: Run `npm install express`
- **RPC connection fails**: Check .env REACT_APP_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL
- **Wallet won't connect**: Verify MetaMask is installed
- **Contract deployment fails**: Check gas fees and network

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success:
- Simple server runs without errors
- Wallet connects and shows balance

## Emergency Reset Protocol
If system becomes unstable:
1. `git stash` - save current work
2. `npm run clean-install` - fresh dependencies
3. Test basic functionality
4. Restore work incrementally
