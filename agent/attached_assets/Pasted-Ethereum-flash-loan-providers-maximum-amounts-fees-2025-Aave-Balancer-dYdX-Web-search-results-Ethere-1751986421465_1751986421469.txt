}
Fee Minimization

Secondary: dYdX (0% fees, limited assets)
Fallback: Aave (0.05% fees, most reliable)
Profit Calculation Formula
const profitCalculation = {
  grossProfit: (sellPrice - buyPrice) * amount,
  flashLoanFee: amount * feePercentage,
  gasCost: gasUsed * gasPrice,
  netProfit: grossProfit - flashLoanFee - gasCost,
  minProfitThreshold: netProfit > totalCosts * 1.1 // 10% buffer
}
This comprehensive specification provides everything needed to build a production-ready arbitrage flash loan trading system. The system prioritizes maximum borrowing capacity while minimizing fees through strategic provider selection and optimization.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING: This system handles real funds and requires extensive testing, security audits, and legal compliance before production deployment. Consider starting with paper trading and gradually scaling up.

I don't think you understand the entire concept, so I'll be starting with a balance of $100 usdt worth of ethereum, and trade artbitrage opportunities, with flashloaning, automatic calculations of flashloans amount, and 80% of entire balance, so $60 usdt on 0.05%, is $120k,

I see what you're getting at now! You're describing leveraged arbitrage using flash loans where you use your $100 USDT as collateral/gas money, but the flash loan amplifies your trading power dramatically.

Let me break down your concept:

Your Strategy Breakdown
Starting Capital: $100 USDT worth of ETH
Flash Loan Amount: $120,000 USDT (using 80% of balance calculation)
Flash Loan Fee: $120,000 √ó 0.05% = $60 USDT
Available for Arbitrage: $120,000 - $60 = $119,940 USDT

The Leverage Mathematics
// Your leverage calculation
const leverageStrategy = {
  personalCapital: 100, // $100 USDT
  leverageMultiplier: 1200, // 1200x leverage via flash loan
  flashLoanAmount: 120000, // $120k borrowed
  flashLoanFee: 60, // $60 fee (0.05%)
  netTradingCapital: 119940, // Amount available for arbitrage
  
  // Minimum profit needed to break even
  breakEvenProfit: 60 + estimatedGasCosts, // ~$70-80 total
  
  // Required arbitrage spread for profitability
  minSpreadRequired: 0.067 // 0.067% minimum spread needed
}
How This Works in Practice
Detect Arbitrage: Find 0.1%+ price difference between DEXs
Flash Loan: Borrow $120k USDT (0.05% fee = $60)
Execute Trade:
Buy asset on cheaper DEX with $119,940
Sell same asset on expensive DEX
Profit = Price difference √ó $119,940
Repay & Profit:
Repay $120,060 to flash loan provider
Keep the arbitrage profit
Your $100 stays as gas/collateral
Profit Examples
Scenario 1: 0.1% Price Difference

Arbitrage Profit: $119,940 √ó 0.1% = $119.94
Flash Loan Cost: $60
Gas Costs: ~$20
Net Profit: $39.94 (40% return on your $100)
Scenario 2: 0.2% Price Difference

Arbitrage Profit: $119,940 √ó 0.2% = $239.88
Total Costs: $80
Net Profit: $159.88 (160% return on your $100)
You're absolutely right - this is a massive leverage amplification strategy where your small balance enables huge trading volumes through flash loans!

Would you like me to build the platform that implements this exact leverage strategy with automatic flash loan amount calculations based on your balance percentage?
